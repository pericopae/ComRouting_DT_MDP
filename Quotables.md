<a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/Publications/dartmouth-reprint.dir/" target="_blank">This thoughtful approach to control issues also guided Vercoe's development of the Synthetic Performer [Vercoe, 1984,Vercoe and Puckette, 1985], which first ran on a 4X machine at IRCAM. The Synthetic Performer demonstrated real-time score following, in which a computer performer automatically synchronized itself with a live player playing a different part. Roger Dannenberg discovered score following independently and showed it the same year [Dannenberg, 1984]. Dannenberg's algorithm performed the analysis portion of the problem more robustly than Vercoe's. But while Dannenberg's design was only concerned with controlling the tempo of a sequencer, Vercoe's system worked at the audio level, obliging him to tackle the problem of managing envelope generators in the face of changing tempi. A representative example of this problem would be to guide a glissando to reach a specific note on a future downbeat, whose time of arrival is constantly being re-estimated in the face of new tempo information.</a>
